SELECT Gender, COUNT(*) FROM Students GROUP BY Gender;

-- Cities with more than 5 students
SELECT City, COUNT(*) FROM Students GROUP BY City HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;

-- Minimum and Maximum age of students
SELECT MIN(Age) AS MinAge, MAX(Age) AS MaxAge FROM Students;

-- Average age by city
SELECT City, AVG(Age) AS AvgAge FROM Students GROUP BY City;
